  <p>Rice is the primary source of food in the Philippines for century unfortunately according to Ricepedia Organization and the<br>
    Department of agriculture Region 9, there are problems in agriculture that do not change but are getting worse especially in rice production such as growing population,<br>
    declining of land area, high cost, and poor drainage and inadequate irrigation facilities. However, the biggest problem that really affects the rice production is climate change,<br>
    which cause a greater loss for famers. In this study titled 'A review of the Agriculture Sector in Western Mindanao Region'. This states that Western Mindanao registered 252.7<br>
    thousand farms for agricultural use, and based on the Philippines population in the year 2021 it is not enough to produce farms for the entire country, and it is mainly because, the farmers has poor supplies and does not have better equipment's for them to farm.<br>
    <br>To improve our rice farms and its yield production we are introducing a Web based rice-farm information management and rice yield production system named Agrivance Pro. This system would help farmers in climate change one of the factors in predicting rice yields.<br>
    Primarily the rice yield depends on weather, planning of harvest operation, diseases and pests. It is important for the farmer to decide which rice variety will have the best production before the harvest takes place.<br>
    Timely and accurate rice yield prediction helps the farmer to ensure maximum production of rice for present and future. We will construct a model in this research considering environmental<br>
    variables on which rice production depends directly and indirectly. It uses the value of sunshine, cloud, wind-speed, humidity, temperature and rainfall for computing the production of certain variety of rice. With the said data attributes,<br>
    it will be use as a data set to produce highly accurate result, moreover the machine learning algorithm to be use in this project are Linear Regression and Neural Network to train the data model which helps to create predictions for yield prediction.<br>
    Therefore, we aim to design our system by which farmers can achieve high production rate and income.<br><br>
    This system would greatly improve our rice farming in the Philippines if developed successfully. It would greatly affect the community especially the rice farms in the Philippines.<br>
    The system will be developed using machine learning, to be exact the use of linear regression formula and neural networking in predicting rice yields. The project will be aiming to make rice farming more productive and efficient in the best possible way.

  <p>1. Who are your target User?<br>
    (answer)-- Individual farmwers/owners within Zamboanga City.<br><br>
    2. What are the factors affecting yield prediction?<br>
    (answer)-- Climate Change (Big Storms), pest and insects and fertilizer.<br><br>
    3. What is your system trying to solve? <br>
    (answer)-- We would like to help the farmers/owners by minimizing the lost in production, and increase the total income.
